Proxy Grabber is an open-source utility designed by me (Azeddine El Massnaoui) to streamline the collection of free proxy server details from online sources. By leveraging wget to extract and filter data from specified websites, it isolates only the free trial proxies offered there, then aggregates them into a single, convenient list for your use.

## 🤔 The Challenge:

Sourcing dependable free proxy servers often involves tedious manual hunts across the web, followed by exhaustive testing. This process is notoriously slow and aggravating.

## 😠 The Pain Point:

Picture wasting entire afternoons scouring sites for proxies, only to discover they're unstable or outright useless—trapped in a loop of frustration and lost productivity.

## 💡 The Solution Teaser:

What if you could automate this entirely, guaranteeing a steady supply of top-quality proxies without the grind?

## ⚙️ The Outcome:

Proxy Grabber eliminates the manual drudgery, delivering fresh proxies effortlessly and freeing up your time for what matters.

## 📲 Quick Setup Guide:

Ensure wget is installed on your system.
Clone the repo to your local environment.
Navigate to the project folder.
Grant execute permissions to the script.
Launch the script to start gathering proxies.

## 📊 Key Benefits:

This tool handles proxy harvesting automatically, slashing time spent on research. It updates the list daily to keep your options current and trustworthy.

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimer:

Proxy Grabber simplifies access to free proxies, but users must commit to ethical and lawful practices. Misuse can lead to serious legal repercussions and damage to shared networks.

## ⚠️ Compatibility Note:
Built for versatility, the script runs seamlessly on Android via Termux, Linux, macOS, and Windows through WSL or Bash environments—provided wget is available.
